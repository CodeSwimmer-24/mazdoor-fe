            that provides Pro Services to the customers. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have
            full legal capacity and authority to agree to and bind yourself to these Terms. If you represent any other
            person, you confirm and represent that you have the necessary power and authority to bind such person to
            these Terms.

            By using the Services, you agree that you have read, understood, and are bound by, these Terms, as amended

            use of DM Credits, by you or any other user, if DM reasonably determines or believes that the use or

            (e) You warrant that you shall not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services.

            (f) You shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Services, any other
            systems or networks connected to the Services, to any of our servers, or through the Platform by hacking,
            password mining, or any other illegitimate means.

            (g) You shall not directly or indirectly, in any capacity, solicit, attempt to influence, engage, approach,
            or accept or encourage the solicitations or approach of, a Service Professional from whom you have availed
            Pro Services, to either terminate or otherwise cease their registration on or engagement with the Platform,
            or avail services the same as or similar to the Pro Services independently, without booking the Pro Services
            through your Account. You agree that this limitation is reasonable and fair and is necessary for the
            protection of the privacy and security of Service Professionals and that this will not preclude you from
            obtaining services the same as or similar to the Pro Services through the Platform or other means. You
            further agree that any potential harm to Service Professionals from the non-enforcement of this clause far
            outweighs any potential harm to you.

            10. OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

            (a) All rights, titles, and interest in, and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights

            or any other form of restriction arising out of your intellectual property rights.

            (c) Except as expressly stated in these Terms, nothing in these Terms should be construed as conferring any
            right in, or license to, our or any third party’s intellectual property rights.

            11. TERM AND TERMINATION

            (a) These Terms shall remain in effect unless terminated in accordance with the terms hereunder.

            (b) We may restrict, deactivate, or terminate your access to, or use of, the Services, or any portion

            obligations, responsibilities, or covenants under these Terms, (B) when you cease to become a user of our
            Services, (C) you do not, or are likely not to qualify under applicable law, or the standards and policies

            (i) the Account will expire;

            (ii) the Services will “time-out”; and

            (iii) these Terms shall terminate, except for those clauses that are expressly, or by implication, intended

            12. DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES

            (a) The Services are provided on an “as is” basis without warranty of any kind, express, implied, statutory
            or otherwise, including without limitation the implied warranties of title, non-infringement,
            merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, we make no warranty
            that the Services will meet your requirements or expectations.

            (b) No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us shall create any warranty
            that is not expressly stated in the Terms.

            Services by any Service Professional, or for any acts or omissions of the Service Professionals during their
            provision of the Pro Services including any damage they may cause to property. By booking Pro Services
            through the Platform, you are entering into a contract with the relevant Service Provider for the provision
            of those services, and we accept no responsibility or liability, nor do we make any warranty,

            (e) You agree and acknowledge that soliciting or receiving services from any Service Professional

            these Terms.

            (f) We do not guarantee or warrant and we make no representation whatsoever regarding the reliability,
            quality, or suitability of the Service Professionals.

            and Pro Services, and expressly agree and acknowledge that we shall have absolutely no liability in this
            regard.

            Professionals in a reasonable manner and in accordance with the non-excludable requirements of relevant
            applicable laws.

            (i) To the fullest extent permissible by law, we, our affiliates, and our related parties, each disclaim all

            access to our records, programmes, services, servers, or other infrastructure relating to the Services;

            (iii) the failure of the Services to remain operational for any period of time; and

            (iv) the loss of any User Content and any other data in connection with your use of the Services.

            punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages (including without limitation, lost business opportunities, lost
            revenues, or loss of anticipated profits or any other pecuniary or non-pecuniary loss or damage of any
            nature whatsoever, including but not limited to any abuse or breach of data), even if DM or an authorized

            Terms, (B) the Services or the Pro Services, (C) your use or inability to use the Services or the Pro
            Services, or (D) any other interactions with another user of the Services.

            (l) Nothing in these Terms will exclude or limit any warranty implied by law that it would be unlawful to
            exclude or limit.

            demand, lawsuits, judicial proceeding, losses, liabilities, damages, and costs (including, without

            are effective immediately upon being posted on the Platform. It is your responsibility to review these Terms
            periodically for any updates or changes. You will be deemed to have accepted the changes made to these Terms
            if you continue to use the Platform once it has been posted.

            (c) Severability: If any provision of these Terms is determined by any court or other competent authority to
            be unlawful or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will continue to be in effect. If any

            will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would
            contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case the entirety of the relevant provision will be
            deemed to be deleted).
